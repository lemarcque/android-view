# Inheritance
## Description
Inheritance is mechanism that enable, at the declaration of a new class, to include the characteristic of another class (called a superclass - also parent class or base class). The class that inherit for the attributes of the superclass is called the subclass or children class, derived class). 

By declaring a new Class B by inheritance of the class A, we can say that:
- A is a generalization of B and B is a specialization of A;
- A is a superclass of B and B is a subclass of A;
- A is a mother class of B and B is a child class of A;
